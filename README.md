`wgpt` is an npm package that allows you to interact with BardAI right from your terminal. With `wgpt`, you can easily send messages to the AI chat, get responses, and even perform rephrasing or add code snippets to your messages. It's a convenient tool for experimenting with AI and generating creative responses.

## Installation

To install `wgpt`, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g wgpt
```

The `-g` flag ensures that `wgpt` is installed globally on your system, making it accessible from any directory.


## Usage
To get started with the CLI tool, you'll be asked to provide a cookie from `https://bard.google.com/`. First, log in to the website and copy the `value` of the `__Secure-1PSID` cookie, which you'll then use as your initial input. After this setup, the tool will operate normally, and you can interact with it directly from your terminal. Below are some usage examples:

```bash
wgpt Hello, AI!
```
